    "reviews": "[{\"user\": \"AMRAVN\", \"score\": 4, \"message\": \"U4iA - Season 1 \\n\\nFull review with screenshots on website.\\n\\nImagine your own family holding you captive. One day, you are released from captivity and end up on the beautiful island of Euphoria, or U4iA for short. What kind of new life will you build for yourself?\\n\\nDriftygames also developed the acclaimed Leap of Faith, known for its emotional gut punching story. A warning beforehand: U4iA was never meant to be like Leap of Faith. The developer deliberately went in a different route, and requested me to await a review until the story actually took off. With season 1 out now, it's finally time to dive into this highly requested game.\\n\\nSTORY\\nAaron is the son of genius scientist Eudorice West and tech tycoon Aiden West. Being mother\\u2019s favorite, Aaron fell out with his father after his mother tragically died from a car accident. The family fued that followed led to Aaron running from his father's grasp, with his childhood friend Jack recommending he comes to Euphoria island. And so he does.\\n\\nU4iA is a sci-fi based novel, focusing on both Aaron\\u2019s pursuit of happiness and the continuation of his mother\\u2019s legacy. Meanwhile, he encounters rumors of a nasty drug roaming the streets of Euphoria, fabricated on the island itself. As Aaron learns more, he slowly realizes why Jack recommended him to the island.\\n\\nDrifty\\u2019s backstory for U4iA is intriguing and typical for dark sci-fi, but doesn't hold the heavy emotional bearing of Leap of Faith. While the story is extensive, the game often employs a \\u2018you will find out later\\u2019 approach, mostly leaving players in the dark until the end. That doesn\\u2019t help the storytelling, as only by piecing together the story shards, you will understand the full timeline. Drifty's choice to have non-linear flashbacks and supposed dream sequences feel cinematic, but also endanger convoluting the storytelling.\\n\\nThe game currently has 19 women for Aaron to flirt with across four chapters, all in varying degrees and backgrounds. Having such a big roster means less detail to interactions, and sadly it shows. Out of the many scenes U4iA presents, about ten of them are actually truly memorable. The range of characters is broad, from introverts like Geneva and Sea to wildcats like Tuesday and Gina. The game could have benefited from a smaller cast, although Drifty skillfully finds a way to connect the women together.\\n\\nThis is most notable in the sometimes unnatural development of some of the characters. At times it feels like we skipped a character development somewhere, even though the overarching story makes sense and responses are well written. U4iA does have a bad habit of signaling upcoming plot twists, spoiling a blindsided surprise. You can sense bad vibes with characters a mile away, probably a side effect of keeping players engaged on a shallow level.\\n\\nThere's also a big focus on side stories, often sidelining the main tech plot. After a full season, we\\u2019ve only now started delving into the meat of the sci-fi story. That story often loses its sense of urgency in season one. U4iA quickly jumps from \\u2018our friend was drugged and abducted\\u2019 to \\u2018let\\u2019s play drinking games and fuck around with our drugged friend present\\u2019, which is understandable given the format, but harms the urgency and weight of the main story.\\n\\nWith so many characters present, the quality of their backstories varies greatly. Geneva is shoehorned into the story with actual plot usage and gets better over time, while characters like Celeste come in with emotional baggage, but ultimately fall flat personality wise. For storytelling, season two could best focus on deepening emotions with existing important characters instead of adding onto it, much like Leap of Faith\\u2019s model. There\\u2019s more than enough to work with.\\n\\nOverall, Drifty did a great job crafting a sci-fi story that can intrigue. We just didn't get to see too much of it yet, because Aaron trips over pussy too often. It is a fun ride that crafts a world for the player to get lost in. The \\u2018survivor\\u2019 stories are interesting and a lot of story progression is on the horizon. Although boasting an interesting story and a lot of bonding between characters, it rarely becomes exceptionally captivating. If I had to guess, the large amount of stories makes it hard to tell rich, deep emotional stories in U4iA.\\n\\nPRESENTATION\\nRenders in U4iA look upgraded from Leap of Faith, with better lighting and detail on all of the characters. The island of Euphoria looks believable and locations, like Aaron\\u2019s trailer or the Hotel look instantly recognizable over all chapters. The quality Drifty's renders simply look better than they ever did.\\n\\nThere's a large diversity of characters across the game. Hair colors ranging from gingers like Teagan and Roxanne, brunettes like Gina and Pearl to blondes like Geneva and Celeste. Both mature women like Evangeline to young adults like Tuesday. Diversity is U4iA\\u2019s strongest suit, as all of these characters have their own lewd scenes. Outfits on all of the characters are pretty varied as well. U4iA has a good, consistent look and many lovely people to look at.\\n\\nIntimate scenes are different, this time around. Not only did Drifty bring back sexy animations, but he's also found a way to make them cinematic and loop-able. Camera angles now pan across characters with depth of field. The result is truly immersive, and the only downside I could find is that it made doing screenshots harder. The result is absolutely cinematic.\\n\\nMost of the intimate scenes are fairly straightforward and some at times feel a bit rushed. The dialog within the scenes can be hit or miss and some are even downright forgettable. Everything looks the part in this game, but somehow the scenes just aren't as enchanting as they were in Leap of Faith. If you are a fan of consistent, nice graphics - U4iA is a good game to add to your list. It ticks a lot of the boxes for a modern day VN and makes sure to put extra emphasis on camerawork during intimate cutscenes. This won't be a simple fap simulator, but you should play this if you can enjoy beautiful models.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nU4iA is a visual novel with many free roam elements in between. Some fans would say, a little too many free roam elements. Each chapter features an enclosed free roam segment where you have to find out who to talk to, and any extra objectives that pop up. There has been a bit of discussion about these elements and reportedly Drifty is looking into a VN only mode.\\n\\nThe visual novel parts are choice based and you will have to play multiple times in order to see everything. Just know that from the start of the dock, you can enter three paths instead of the obvious two. The third path is not picking a woman to talk to and going into the city by yourself. While choices didn't always seem super clear in their expectation to me, the choice structure works fairly well and often, you know what to expect.\\n\\nDrifty once again makes use of a phone interface for a lot of miscellaneous things like text messages, gallery, music, social media and cash handling. There are specific text message segments that allow you to select answers and you will have to approve most money transfers for your bank account, while you can always check your CashMe account balance.\\n\\nOne thing to note about the free roam elements is that positions can change during your playtime. A person might be somewhere at one point, and could not be there after you have interacted with someone else. That may confuse players on what to do, but the answer is almost always to go looking for that person.\\n\\nYou will most likely need three playthroughs to see all of the content, and having to go through multiple freeroam elements multiple times that you can't really skip might get to some people. Just be aware you'll have to sink in quite some time if that's something you want to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL\\nU4iA is a great game that tells a futuristic tale of escapism and capitalism on a beautiful island. The love interests and other characters in the game are often fun, vibrant and while a little shallow at times, fit the tone of the game. As long as you don't mind free roam segments and you don't expect going into Leap of Faith 2, you will probably have a great time on the island of Euphoria.\\n\\nDeveloper: Driftygames\", \"likes\": 3, \"timestamp\": 1764723596}, {\"user\": \"Ravenquartz\", \"score\": 3, \"message\": \"[MINOR SPOILER]\\n\\nThis review is based on my experience before Drifty dropped the final episode for season 1. As of today, I have yet to try the fourth episode. \\n\\nThere are some good and bad things about this AVN. The problem is, the bad kinda outweights the good here. The only good things that I see from this visual novel are the quality of its renders and it\\u2019s a choice-based AVN like his previous product, which the thing that I like about my VNs because I\\u2019m not really a huge fan of kinetic VNs. \\n\\nNow here comes the bad. First, I hate the fact that there\\u2019s too many love interests in u4ia. Leap of Faith has six love interests in total so it\\u2019s no biggie to make them even in equality department. While u4ia has a lot, probably ten or more and that\\u2019s a huge problem if can\\u2019t make them even. I noticed that some girls don\\u2019t get enough screentime or lewds in the first season. Hell, you don\\u2019t even know which ones are the main girls or side girls (if there\\u2019s any). I was initially pursued Teagan, but the more I keep going, the more I realized that she keeps disappearing from the MC and he doesn\\u2019t even try to look for her, even though me as the player have made a lot of choices that favored her. Funny enough, Jackie who\\u2019s not in my radar whatsoever always poppin\\u2019 up in my crib and she has more scenes than Teagan and she\\u2019s not even attractive at all (well, she was before she escaped to The Bahamas).\\n\\nI also had a complaint about u4ia\\u2019s freeroams. They were tedious, way too many, and not time efficient at all. My main complaint is the usage of arrows in huge area such as the hotel and mansion, should\\u2019ve used images like what we got in Desert Stalker or Being a DIK. But I heard from people that the newest release removed the timer and other inconvenient things. I have yet to see it so no comment on this one. \\n\\nAnyway, the story is\\u2026 okay. It\\u2019s not the best and it\\u2019s not the worst either. It\\u2019s clear that Drifty is not trying to imitate the magic of Leap of Faith in his second VN and that\\u2019s fine to me. As for now, the emotional pull isn\\u2019t there and the main plot hasn\\u2019t been addressed as the main focus (yet). Most of the time it\\u2019s just MC having fun with folks he meet along the way. There\\u2019s an unseen danger lurking around every corner, but he always brushed them off. We\\u2019ll see what he\\u2019s gonna do with it in season 2. \\n\\nOverall, I\\u2019ll give this game three stars in its current state. Who knows, maybe in the future it could get four or five stars instead. \", \"likes\": 0, \"timestamp\": 1762750078}, {\"user\": \"sudisudimagi\", \"score\": 4, \"message\": \"Another Drifty games banger, although the story was not as great as it's predecessor, it still kept me engaged through out the first season.\\nIt does take a darker tone compared to LoF, some of it being like a soap opera type drama but the characters are cool regardless.\\nI am interested on what's to come in second season, which might be some years away.\", \"likes\": 0, \"timestamp\": 1760302894}, {\"user\": \"DuckWalker\", \"score\": 4, \"message\": \"4 stars because you cannot give 3.5 star, but it deserves better than 3.\\n\\nCharacter designs - Good, not the best but good.

It's a bit of a slow burn but is more focused on slice of life with the girls. I don't mind this, but certain girls feel less relevant to the overall story than others. It's prob that every main girl feels like a main girl - but from the developers perspective, they are a  side girl. It doesn't come across in the writing. You feel like you're missing scenes with some.\\n\\nAnimations: Best in class. This is a good porn game if you're here for the porn. But there's the path stuff - you won't see it if you won't engage with it. But honestly maximum points if you're attracted to the subject of the scene. The visuals are great.\\n\\nOverall: Solid 5/5 from me. But I appreciate animated scenes. If your focus is more story and character build up, I'd say 4.5/5. Top tier regardless. Drifty knows what they're doing.\\n\\nSandbox: A bunch of people hate on this. I don't really get it. Like - they ask you to choose an arrow based on what area you want to view. It's really UN-intuitive - i get that but it's not like.... other AVN's where you're wondering what's going on. Either something happens or it doesn't. It it a touch clunky - yes.

Lars is one of the best buddy/friends, I've found in a VN. However there's just a constant, boring mess of free roams that slow down the enjoyment of the story. I'm going for 4 stars as this has the potential to get better as it goes on judging by episode 4 but really its a 3 1/2.

While playing through, at first, I felt a little disappointed until I took a step back to think about things. In my own mind, I was already comparing a complete product to one that had just hit the ground running and has barely even taken flight.\\n\\nAfter a few playthroughs now, I think the game does a very good job of building up the world and the characters in it, as well as forming and building bonds between the characters with each other and with the MC. Choices also feel quite impactful.\\n\\nThe key here is patience.\\n\\nIt really wasn't until episode 4 that I really began opening up to this game. Without any spoilers, it has taken a long time to get to the point where we finally start finding out what is going on with the overarching plot of the story. A whole season. Someone that's expecting a quick adventure might find it a bit aggravating or wearisome even. But I fully believe in my heart of hearts that it will be worth it in the end. The story is building up for something much larger.\\n\\nGive this game a chance. A real chance. Be patient with it and at least, give it the time it deserves, because I truly believe it will reward and respect your commitment with a beautiful experience, in time.\\n\\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10\", \"likes\": 10, \"timestamp\": 1757240133}, {\"user\": \"Hahn1900\", \"score\": 3, \"message\": \"I have my problems with the game... \\n\\nGameplaywise the freeroams are just shitty. There are other games with free roams too, but in the good games those free roams have a good reason and serve a purpose in at least someway, in this game this is not the case, not one bit, and they are made poorly. \\n\\nThe models are overall better than in leap of faith, but not by much, and certainly not all of them, just some. \\n\\nThe strongest part of leap of faith were the emotions and the somewhat relateable characters, and you could easily sense that there is some \\\"real\\\" story behind all this... thats why the game worked so well. Well... for the most part at least.\\n\\nThe emotional part in u4ia is just... non existent. I cant relate to anyone in this game, not the MC, not anyone. Mostly because we dont know shit about them. Its all in the shadows, still is after season 1 is complete now. It stills feel like the introduction episode, and that is just awful. \\n\\nDrifty tries hard in the early stages to establish some \\\"romance\\\" here and there, but drops the ball with episode 3. At that point every interaction becomes meaningless with any of the girls, which is sad. \\n\\nAt the end of episode 4 the whole game becomes outright pointless and ridiculous. The dating part and such... is just down the drain for the overall \\\"thriller conspiracy story\\\"... and thats the biggest problem of the game. The story... lets face it, if the DEVs of these game would be high class authors, the would write movie sceenplays or books, but they dont. To pull off a good thriller story, you have to be a real good author, and drifty is not. \\n\\nThe whole evil daddy android creater ruler of the world things is just stupid. And of course everyone is tangled up in that because they are somewhat tergeted by said evil daddy... yeah... well... whatever man. I cant get over how ridicullous the conclusion at the end of ep 4 is. \\n\\nI might play the game agian when its complete, cause at least drifty can deliver a \\\"fun time\\\" here and there... but he shouldnt have tried this thriller-story thing in the first place. Not everyone is a david fincher, stzpehen king, don winslow, dan bron or so, and trying to be one is ending up poorly most of the times. Especially if you are just creating a fun little dating-porn game and try to mix in some over the top thriller story in it... its just... get out of here.\\n\\nSo yeah.\\n\\nStory bad, graphics not much improved compared to LoF, dialogues are still ag ood thing drifty can pull of, and the funny parts too, but they dont fit the story at all. The characters are just unbelievable in every way, espeically later on in the game... somewhgat believable in the first two episode, they become complete nonsense in episode 3 and 4. Especially the end of episode 3 and episode 4 sink the ship completley. Drifty cant get out of this mess anymore now... \\n\\nLeap of Faith was just a emotional rollercoaster and worked well as that. \\n\\nThis u4ia wants to be a big thing in every regard and fails in every regard. \\n\\nStill, compared to most of the games on F95 its still decent, so yeah... 3 stars it is.

However, as good as some elements of the game are, they are gate-kept by some truly rage-inducing free-roam events. Events which would have been unwelcome in a harem game where most of the content can be unlocked in a single playthrough, but are truly unforgivable when there are half a dozen routes to unlock. This, coupled with a slow-to-start main plot and characters who, so far, are attractive but forgettable, it\\u2019s difficult to justify cleaning out the garbage in that goddamned trailer for the 3rd, or 4th, or umpteenth time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis review itself is difficult to write. I\\u2019ve deleted several full paragraphs already. I want to go down the typical list, like, \\u201cSo the animation is well done and the characters are unique and beautiful and rendered well and the environments are interesting and memorable.\\u201d I keep deleting them though because the faults in the game\\u2019s design overwhelm them completely. I\\u2019ve tried and tried to get back into the game. \\u201cI\\u2019ll start playthrough tomorrow after I finish the update to this other game.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nIt just doesn\\u2019t happen because I know what I\\u2019m in for: The free-roam events from hell. One of the biggest benefits of Ren\\u2019py is the ability to fast forward, especially in games that promote multiple playthroughs with only minor variations. We\\u2019ve all been there. Burning through the first four chapters of a game, quickly picking the options the mod highlights in green, until you get to the choices that effect that route you haven\\u2019t tried yet. We don\\u2019t have all the time in the world to click through a tedious, and pointless, free-roam event that would have worked better as a montage than forcing me to click on individual pieces of garbage and furniture before clicking arrow keys to move to a second room to click on other pieces of furniture before clicking several other keys to leave the trailer, go to a second door into the same trailer, click over to three other rooms, and pixel hunt for the garbage in THOSE rooms that need to be cleaned up, without which the girl I\\u2019m trying to bang will note the garbage I didn\\u2019t clean up and go home early.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom a design standpoint, it makes no sense. Drifty has to have played other games before. Did he ever play one with such events and thought, \\u201cWow, I wish there more of these!\\u201d?\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, enough about the free roam. A quick bit about the other elements. The update schedule is on the long side, so I honestly can\\u2019t remember any of the names of the characters or remember much about the plot, which again is a problem since I need to play the game over again and sonofabitch I\\u2019m talking about the free roam events again!\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay. Last try. Short short version: Characters pretty. Plot mysteries have my attention but need to be shored up faster before I lose interest. Music is great and well thought-out. Adult content is pleasant. Well-written and not same-y at all. MC is a decent bloke. Not ugly but not a super model either. I like him. Stat system and attributes need to be thrown out. No one likes them, and no one wants to be gate-kept from content because their confidence/intelligence/agility/smarminess hadn\\u2019t reached lvl 6 before the scene played. Don\\u2019t give the mod-makers more to do. They got enough trouble green-lighting all the different path dialogues.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\u2019m playing another game right now, far superior to this one I\\u2019m sad to say, and its main point of superiority is its more annoying content includes a \\u201cwould you like to skip the annoying shit?\\u201d button before it starts. Without that button, the game in question would be a 2. Instead, I gave it a 5. I\\u2019ll be doing the same here. I love ya Drifty, but please take these criticisms, echoed by many others, to heart. It\\u2019s fine if you enjoy making free-roam events, but shelve the ego and add elements for those who don\\u2019t like them to be able to skip them and still enjoy everything else your game has to offer. Maybe code it so that you have to go through them at least once. \\u201cLooks like this is your second/third/twelfth playthrough. Would you like to skip the club scene with the best route choices for VeroniFeliciaDesireeebeca?\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nI really really want to play your game, but the mere thought of cleaning up that trailer again is preventing me from doing so.

It totally breaks the immersion into the story, you are back to playing a 90\\u2019s game (ok, ok, the first Doom in 1993 was fun to play) instead of an adult visual novel. Too bad, Leap of Faith is still in my all-time top 5 and had none of this shit, it was indeed super-immersive, breath-taking, very emotional and hilarious at the same time.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s talk about the MC now. He doesn\\u2019t have the charisma of the one from LoF and has been seen in too many other AVNs by now to have his own identity. Why choose an average \\u2013 totally not handsome \\u2013 guy when you have much better on offer? I mean, this guy is supposed to seduce a dozen attractive girls but has a weird face and tramp clothes all the time. Why is his friend Lars muuuuch better looking than him? Oooooh sorry, the MC has a big fat d*ck, must be the reason why he is so popular, I forgot about it...\\n\\nRenders are quite good, animations are ok but well, it\\u2019s 2024, we\\u2019ve seen much better ones by now. Btw, the last scene of Episode 3 with Synne is terrible, like it was not completed before the game had to be released on the market.\\n\\nThe story: It\\u2019s quite captivating but I\\u2019m afraid it\\u2019s going in too many directions, with too many questions and no real answer so far, and I\\u2019m afraid Drifty will get lost at some point in the process. Each of the girls has a past, a story to tell, and we\\u2019ve barely scratched the surface yet, we know almost nothing about them, we even have a total alien (Nyah) and at least one or two traitors working for someone who governs this island. The story already has too many ramifications, and it\\u2019s only the third episode, I can\\u2019t even imagine the number of unanswered questions we\\u2019ll have at the end of the game. I just hope I\\u2019m totally wrong here but even in the movie industry such mistakes happen all the time and they have crews of professionals behind them.\\n\\nSorry for the low rating Drifty, but you deserve it for implementing such a totally useless freeroam system. Just imagine your game with simple menus and how much more immersive it would be. I have 4 different playthroughs at the moment and it\\u2019s been a pain to do all the freeroam shits 4 times, thank you very much. I would have never thought that you, the creator of the wonderful Leap of Faith, would lower yourself as to copy what everyone else is doing just to fool the players into thinking that their game is 2 times longer than it really is\\u2026\\n\\nUpdate Season 1 :\\n\\nEpisode 4 is the best episode so far, it\\u2019s a mix of emotional and funny moments, Drifty\\u2019s specialty. Unfortunately it ends with a 3-phases free-roam. I now have 7 playthroughs, so let\\u2019s do the math: 7x3=21. Yes, you saw it right, I had to do 21 free-roams. They\\u2019re not long or complicated, you go from one room to the other, but it\\u2019s damn annoying after the 10th time\\u2026\\n\\n2,5/5, almost 3, thanks to episode 4. Could be a 4/5 next season if Drifty finally gets rid of the free-roams entirely.\", \"likes\": 21, \"timestamp\": 1732385140}]",
